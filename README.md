# Sports-analysis
Repository containing all of the mini projects about a passion of mine - sports. These are interesting to me, because of the different analysis that can be done using numbers and data. 
The first mini project is: analysing the 2021-2022 UEFA Champions League players. The goal was to find any interesting factors about this particular competiton.
