# Sports-analysis
Repo containing all of the mini projects about a passion of mine - sports. These are interesting to me, because of the different analysis that can be done using numbers and data. 
The first mini project is: analysing the 2021-2022 UEFA Champions League players. Even though it is a small sample size, there are some interesting conclusion. For example, even though Real Madrid won the Champions League this year, they were not in the top ten in the number of goalscorers. This shows that their goals came from a limited number of people, namely Karim Benzema.
