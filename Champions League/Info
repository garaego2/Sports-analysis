Even though it is a small sample size, there are some interesting conclusion. For example, even though Real Madrid 
won the Champions League this year, they were not in the top ten in the number of goalscorers. 
This shows that their goals came from a limited number of people, namely Karim Benzema. The key was to not concede as shown by the 
number of goals scored vs. conceded.
