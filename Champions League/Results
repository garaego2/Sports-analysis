Even though it is a small sample size, there are some interesting conclusions. 
Fact 1: Even though Real Madrid won the Champions League this year, they were not in the top ten for the number of goalscorers. 
  This shows that their goals came from a limited number of people, namely Karim Benzema. In this case, it was better to have one plan 
  for scoring goals. However, the problem is that the team has to rely on that person, whcih worked out for Real, but might not for 
  other teams.

Fact 2: Even though approximately 8.2% of people in the world are left footed, the percent of goals scored with the left foot is 34%. 
  Four times the amount of left footed people. It is also more than the percentage of left footed professional footballers, which is 19%.
  This could be due to defenders preparing nad "locking out" an attackers right foot, which frees up an angle for the left. Of course, 
  professional footballers are highly proficient with both feet and even though the left is worse, they can still strike it with skill. 

Fact 3: In the top ten of fouls per match there are only two defenders. This is counter intuitive, since it could be assumed that
  the last line of defence would have to stop the attackers by breaking the rules most often. However, tis could be attributed to
  tactical fouls. These are fouls that are committed in order to stop the attack before it gets dangerous. 

Fact 4: The goals conceded per match shows that the three of the four semifinalists are fourth, fifth and sixth in the least goals
  conceded per match. The only excpetion is Man City, but their attack is so high quality that it compensates the defensive lack  
  of quality. Even though those three teams faced better competition, they kept the goals conceded to the minimum. 

In conclusion, looking at the eventual victor of this tournament, Real Madrid, to win the Champions League you need a few things.
You need to have one primary goal scorer, a solid defence and foul very little.
